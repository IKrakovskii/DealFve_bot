Make a surprise for him, whatever he really wants, just make sure that it will make him happy
Playboy
Say “yes” for him for a week
Take him to an amusement park
Make him breakfast in the bed
Buy him a car with an automatic controller
Take him to the cinema, find something really interesting, something that he likes ( Avatar 2 for example )
Find a basketball game in your city and take him there
Buy something for him: brownie cookies, cute hat,, funny pajama
Make a relax day for him: massage, bath, good food, today only u should care about dog, he should just relax and enjoy
