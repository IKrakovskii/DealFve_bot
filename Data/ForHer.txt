Say her “yes” for a day
Take her on the coolest date of her life
Give her a good massage
Cook something tasty for her
Make something for her using your hands, hand-made, use your imagination
Buy something for her: candies, flowers, toy, funny pajama
Surprise her with something unusual, use your imagination, she should be in shock (but not in a bad way)
Let her chill a little bit, make a bath for her, cut some fruits, give her a glass of wine and turn on her favorite movie
Play some games with her
Make something tasty for her
